The woods are gently lit by fireflies, and through the swaying leaves above, the stars can be seen twinkling in the pernament night that reins here. Various woodland creatures can be found in this biome, such as peacefully"

Whether this was an attempt to provide light to the forest by some lost civilization, or a strange experiment on the many fireflies that seem to congregate here, it is impossible to say."
